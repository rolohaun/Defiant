## Description

These are the necessary parts to fit a Trianglelabs CHC Pro hotend to the modified Eva3 toolhead on Rolohaun's Defiant cross-gantry printer.

## Details

Included is a modified version of [3DP-MAMSIH's EVA 3.0 E3DV6 - REVO - REVO Micro ( Hotends ) Mount](https://www.printables.com/model/201093-eva-30-e3dv6-revo-revo-micro-hotends-mount) that fits the version of the Eva3 toolhead on defiant, a lengthened version of the 5015 adapter, and lengthened version of the klicky switch extender. Assembly should be fairly self explanatory.

## Concerns

I suspect that the clamp will need to be beefed back up. I also have concerns that the clicky switch extender spring will be prone to failure. The latter should show up in the klicky repo's issues if it's a problem already, though.
